                <p class="p5"> Introduction: With graceful steps and enigmatic gaze, who can tell my true gender? - The
                    History of Cross-dressing Performance</p>
                <p class="p6">On the theatrical stage, actors challenging gender boundaries through cross-dressing has a
                    long history. Indeed, the history of theater is almost as long as the history of cross-dressing
                    performance. From the moment actors first donned costumes, they began exploring cross-dressing,
                    trying on the garments of the opposite gender. Initially, this practice arose because women were
                    restricted from performing on stage due to traditional moral constraints, so men played female
                    roles. Later, it evolved into mutual cross-dressing between male and female actors. Today, amid
                    rapid social development, cross-dressing performance has become an exquisite means of interpreting
                    gender relations, like a magical key unlocking new doors to gender perception. With the emergence of
                    transgender minorities, traditional male-to-female and female-to-male cross-dressing is no longer
                    just an eye-catching cultural phenomenon, but has elegantly transformed into a crucial element of
                    performing arts, with specific rules and presenting various fascinating forms. Now, let us raise the
                    curtain and explore the history of theatrical cross-dressing together.</p>


                <h3>China</h3>
                <div class="fdsfd">
                    <div class="lef">
                        <p>Chinese cross-dressing performance has a long history, mainly manifested in the following
                            aspects:</p>
                        <p>Cross-dressing Tradition in Chinese Opera:</p>
                        <p>Male actors playing female roles (dan roles): This is a common form of cross-dressing in
                            Chinese opera with deep historical roots. In Chinese classical theater history, male dan
                            performers were once highly popular and formed a significant mainstream presence. This was
                            primarily because male dan artists had unique expressive abilities. After special training,
                            they could combine male vocal strength with female gentleness to achieve a distinctive
                            aesthetic beauty. For example, Peking Opera master Mei Lanfang's singing was rich and
                            rounded, skillfully portraying feminine delicacy and gentleness.</p>
                

                    </div>
                    <div class="image-placeholder"> <img src="./img/图片 1.jpg" alt=""></div>
                </div>
                <p>Moreover, under strict feudal ethical norms in ancient times, interaction between men and
                    women was greatly restricted. Women were required to stay at home and could not easily
                    appear in public, let alone perform on stage. As opera was a form of mass entertainment
                    requiring various character portrayals, to meet performance needs while not violating feudal
                    ethical constraints, female roles were initially mostly played by male actors. Female
                    performers didn't appear until the Tongzhi and Guangxu periods of the late Qing Dynasty, and
                    mixed-gender performances didn't occur until the 1930s during the Republic period. The "Four
                    Great Dan Masters" of Peking Opera - Mei Lanfang, Cheng Yanqiu, Shang Xiaoyun, and Xun
                    Huisheng - were outstanding male dan representatives who, through their superb performances
                    and unique artistic charm, portrayed female roles with perfect authenticity, making
                    important contributions to the development of opera arts.</p>
                <p>Female Actors in Male Roles: "Kun" (坤) in the Eight Trigrams represents earth and femininity,
                    in contrast to "Qian" (乾) which represents heaven and masculinity. "Sheng" (生) in
                    traditional Chinese opera typically refers to male character types, such as Laosheng (老生,
                    older male roles) and Xiaosheng (小生, young male roles). Therefore, "Kunsheng" (坤生) refers to
                    female performers who play male roles.</p>
                <p>Kunsheng emerged around the late Qing Dynasty and early Republican period. The main reasons for its
                    emergence were:</p>
                <p>1. Social Changes: As the Qing Dynasty's control weakened, cultural restrictions loosened. Around the
                    20th year of Emperor Guangxu's reign, female performers began appearing on stage first in Shanghai,
                    then in Tianjin. Previously, the Qing government had long prohibited female performers in artistic
                    troupes. These changes in the social environment created conditions for the emergence of Kunsheng.
                </p>
                <p>2. Changing Audience Demands: Audiences of the time were accustomed to male performers and had a
                    strong curiosity for new performance styles. Theater troupes with all-female casts were novel and
                    attracted large audiences, providing a market for Kunsheng's development.</p>
                <div class="fdsfff">
                    <div class="lef">
                        <p>For example, Mao Weitao, a renowned Yue Opera performer, often plays male roles on stage. Her
                            performances are characterized by grace and dignity, displaying a unique artistic style.
                            This form of female-to-male cross-dressing performance has added a distinctive charm to
                            traditional Chinese opera.</p>

                <p>Cross-dressing Narratives in Literature and Folk Tales:</p>
                <div class="fdsfd">
                    <div class="lef">
                        <p>Female-to-Male Cross-dressing: In Chinese traditional literature and folklore, stories of
                            women dressing as men are abundant. A famous example is Hua Mulan from the Northern and
                            Southern Dynasties period, who disguised herself as a man to serve in the army in her
                            father's place. She became a symbol of female heroism through her brave battlefield
                            achievements. Another well-known story is "The Butterfly Lovers" (Liang Shanbo and Zhu
                            Yingtai), where Zhu Yingtai dressed as a man to attend school, leading to her meeting and
                            falling in love with Liang Shanbo, ultimately becoming a tragic love story. These narratives
                            reflect ancient women's pursuit of freedom and equality, showcasing their courage and
                            wisdom.</p>

                </div>
                <p>Male-to-Female Cross-dressing: Though less common, there are some records of male-to-female
                    cross-dressing in literature and folklore. For instance, some Ming Dynasty literary works
                    describe men who disguised themselves as women for various purposes. However, these male
                    cross-dressing characters often had questionable motives, contrasting sharply with the
                    positive portrayals of female cross-dressers.</p>
                <p>The Significance of Cross-dressing Narratives: These stories carry profound meaning.
                    Female-to-male cross-dressing represents ancient women's resistance against traditional
                    gender constraints, demonstrating their pursuit of personal development and self-worth. It
                    highlights women's courage and wisdom, inspiring future generations to fight for their
                    rights and status, while reflecting society's longing for freedom and equality.</p>
                <p>Male-to-female cross-dressing enriched literary expression by adding diversity and dramatic
                    elements. It revealed the complexity of human nature and reminded people to examine
                    motivations more deeply. By contrast, it emphasized the positive significance of female
                    cross-dressing, reinforced positive female images, and provided insight into historical
                    gender perspectives and the challenges faced by women in ancient times.</p>

                <h3>In Western Theater</h3>
                <div class="fdsfde">
                    <div class="lef">
                        <p>In ancient Greece, most theatrical performance traditions can be traced back to that ancient
                            era, and cross-dressing performances were no exception. During that time, while dramatic
                            arts were highly revered, women's social status was extremely low, to the extent that women
                            were generally forbidden from performing on stage. As a result, male actors had to play
                            female roles out of necessity. In fact, this "all-male" performance practice was just one
                            small reflection of the broader gender inequality that existed in society at that time.</p>
                      
                    </div>
                    <div class="image-placeholder"> <img src="./img/图片 4.jpg" alt=""></div>
                </div>
                <p>The Shakespearean Period: During this time, at the height of the Renaissance, humanist ideas
                    were widely spreading alongside the flourishing arts. Shakespeare's works deeply embodied
                    the humanist spirit, and the female characters he created possessed distinct personalities
                    and complex emotions, each uniquely charming in their pursuit of freedom, love, and
                    happiness.</p>
                <p>However, since women were not allowed on stage, these roles were performed by men at the
                    time. Young boys would typically play the female roles, likely because they had narrower
                    shoulders than adult men, softer facial features, and shorter stature. They would use
                    corsets to create a feminine silhouette and apply makeup to appear more womanly. In
                    Shakespeare's time, these male performers playing female roles achieved surprisingly
                    effective results.</p>
                <p>For example, the gender disparity created strong comedic effects, such as exaggerated affected poses
                    and falsetto voice imitations, which made the theatrical atmosphere light and humorous. This added
                    symbolic meaning by:</p>
                <p>1. Breaking gender boundaries and symbolizing gender ambiguity</p>
                <p>2. Suggesting the complexity and multi-faceted nature of human character</p>
                <p>3. Prompting audiences to reflect on gender roles and identity</p>
                <p>Additionally, male actors' voices could create unique tonal qualities and singing styles, adding
                    charm to the characters. They also had physical advantages in performance, being able to better
                    demonstrate power and expressiveness in movement, which provided more possibilities for character
                    development.</p>

                <p>"Twelfth Night" is a Shakespearean comedy that primarily tells the story of Viola, who disguises

                    <div class="lef">

                        <p>Victorian Era: The term "drag" in English likely emerged during this period. At the time,
                            male actors
                            performing female roles would wear extravagant, heavy, long dresses that would "drag" across
                            the
                            stage - this is how the term "drag" gradually evolved to refer to cross-dressing
                            performance.
                            However, simultaneously, another school of playwrights (like Shaw and Wilde) emerged
                            advocating for
                            "reality restoration," believing actors should play roles of their own gender. This changed
                            the more
                            performance-oriented nature of theater. With political stability and economic prosperity,
                            post-theater streets became safer, and the theater industry flourished, with productions
                            running
                            longer. </p>

                <p>
                    This theatrical era ultimately gave birth to perhaps history's most famous
                    cross-dressed
                    role - Peter Pan. Female actors were typically better at portraying Peter Pan's innocent
                    qualities,
                    with their nuanced performances conveying the character's purity. Women's physical
                    flexibility and
                    agility gave them advantages in portraying Peter Pan's lightness and grace in actions like
                    flying
                    and jumping. Audiences not only "accepted" but "desired" female actors in this role.

                        <p>Japanese Theater: Kabuki originated in early 17th century Japan. It began with a shrine
                            maiden named Okuni performing novel dances in Kyoto, cross-dressing as a man. Her passionate
                            and energetic performances were warmly received by the public and are considered Kabuki's
                            origin. As Kabuki grew popular, geishas and courtesans began performing, leading to
                            increasingly vulgar content. To maintain public morality, women were banned from Kabuki
                            performances.</p>

                </div>
                <p>Thereafter, male actors began playing female roles, establishing the tradition of all-male
                    Kabuki. Male actors meticulously imitated feminine gestures, movements, and emotions through
                    sophisticated makeup, costumes, and performance techniques. However, young male performers
                    soon created new problems, becoming objects of desire for nobles and wealthy merchants. The
                    shogunate issued another decree limiting Kabuki to adult males and requiring more emphasis
                    on artistic value and moral standards. Over time, male Kabuki developed its unique
                    performance style, emphasizing subtle expression in movement and facial expressions, using
                    exaggerated techniques to convey character emotions and personalities. They created many
                    unique dance movements and performance techniques.</p>

                        <p>Modern Cross-dressing Art: With social progress and cultural diversification, aesthetic views
                            have become more open and inclusive. Modern cross-dressing art is gaining widespread
                            acceptance, showing unique charm and value. People have begun appreciating this
                            gender-transcending artistic expression, recognizing that art shouldn't be limited by rigid
                            gender norms. Female performers playing male roles have their own unique appeal. Audiences,
                            knowing it's performance, admire the artistic achievement more. Crossing gender boundaries
                            requires high artistic quality and skill. When actresses bring male characters to life, they
                            reinterpret and reconstruct through understanding and creativity, demonstrating profound
                            artistic comprehension and mastery. Audiences appreciate the effort in character creation,
                            including attention to detail, exploration of inner worlds, and application of performance
                            techniques. Whether it's men portraying feminine grace or women showing masculine charm, it
                            demonstrates art's infinite possibilities. Modern media has positively promoted acceptance
                            of cross-dressing art through TV programs and short video platforms like Douyin and
                            Kuaishou. For example, Chen Lijun's cross-dressed role as Jia Ting in "New Dragon Gate Inn"
                            demonstrates this art form's contemporary appeal.</p>

                    Conclusion: Cross-dressing art emerged under oppression, carrying historical weight and human
                    resilience. In many countries and eras, gender restrictions constrained artistic expression like
                    heavy shackles. However, cross-dressing art persevered. From male dan roles in Chinese opera showing
                    "unparalleled elegance," to men playing women in ancient Greek theater when women were excluded, to
                    Victorian era drag performances, to Japanese Kabuki's male-only tradition - all reflect society's
                    gender inequities and suppression.

                    But cross-dressing art wasn't suppressed. It shows us gender shouldn't restrict personal development
                    and expression. Everyone has the right to show their multiple facets beyond traditional gender
                    frameworks, seeking their own "free sky." Today's society should strongly support gender fluidity,
                    letting cross-dressing art flourish in freedom. We call for understanding and inclusion -
                    understanding the historical origins and profound meaning of cross-dressing art, embracing artists
                    who bravely cross gender boundaries. With open minds, we should accept different artistic
                    expressions and learn to respect and embrace differences in this artistically beautiful world.
