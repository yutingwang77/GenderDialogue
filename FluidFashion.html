                   <p class="p2">The theme of this poker deck, "Cultural Flow," was inspired by an unforgettable experience at the ESAP summer school. There, friends from around the world gathered, learning various poker games from different countries, turning a simple deck of cards into a bond connecting us all. Coincidentally, I was conducting academic research on the Silk Road at that time. These two experiences unexpectedly converged in my mind, sparking my creative inspiration.</p>
                   <p class="p2">As a result, I meticulously illustrated each card in the poker deck with iconic buildings along the Silk Road, such as the Great Wall, mosques, and Buddhist pagodas. These structures not only showcase the cultural characteristics of the regions along the route but also symbolize the exchange and integration between different civilizations.</p>
                   <p class="p2">The background of each card features an ingenious mathematical infinity symbol, presented with a silken texture, cleverly echoing the role of silk as a crucial trade commodity on this ancient route. The circular design of the symbol implies the endless, cyclical nature of cultural exchange, while the intersection point of the infinity symbol represents the convergence of Eastern and Western civilizations, highlighting the dynamic process of cultural integration.</p>
                   <p class="p2">This poker deck not only embodies my reflections on cultural exchange but also carries the beautiful memories of time spent with friends from all over the world</p>

               <p class="p2">My nail art design is themed "Gender Fluidity." This design stems from my reflections on and concern for the diversity of gender identities. Each pattern carries a special meaning: the colors of the non-binary flag and star patterns represent diversity; the cloud-like, unknown, and flowing marble texture symbolizes the complexity and variability of gender identity; the restraint and chain patterns suggest breaking free from traditional gender concept constraints; and various symbols represent different forms of gender expression. Through this design, I hope to convey an important message: gender identity is fluid and diverse, and everyone should have the freedom to define and express themselves. I aim to encourage people to understand and respect different gender identities with an open and inclusive attitude, hoping to contribute to promoting social acceptance of gender diversity.</p>
