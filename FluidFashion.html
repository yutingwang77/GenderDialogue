                        <p class="p2">The theme of this poker deck, "Cultural Flow," was inspired by an unforgettable
                            experience at the ESAP summer school. There, friends from around the world gathered,
                            learning various poker games from different countries, turning a simple deck of cards into a
                            bond connecting us all. Coincidentally, I was conducting academic research on the Silk Road
                            at that time. These two experiences unexpectedly converged in my mind, sparking my creative
                            inspiration.</p>
                        <p class="p2">As a result, I meticulously illustrated each card in the poker deck with iconic
                            buildings along the Silk Road, such as the Great Wall, mosques, and Buddhist pagodas. These
                            structures not only showcase the cultural characteristics of the regions along the route but
                            also symbolize the exchange and integration between different civilizations.</p>
                        <p class="p2">The background of each card features an ingenious mathematical infinity symbol,
                            presented with a silken texture, cleverly echoing the role of silk as a crucial trade
                            commodity on this ancient route. The circular design of the symbol implies the endless,
                            cyclical nature of cultural exchange, while the intersection point of the infinity symbol
                            represents the convergence of Eastern and Western civilizations, highlighting the dynamic
                            process of cultural integration.</p>
                        <p class="p2">This poker deck not only embodies my reflections on cultural exchange but also
                            carries the beautiful memories of time spent with friends from all over the world</p>

                        <p class="p2">My nail art design is themed "Gender Fluidity." This design stems from my
                            reflections on and concern for the diversity of gender identities. Each pattern carries a
                            special meaning: the colors of the non-binary flag and star patterns represent diversity;
                            the cloud-like, unknown, and flowing marble texture symbolizes the complexity and
                            variability of gender identity; the restraint and chain patterns suggest breaking free from
                            traditional gender concept constraints; and various symbols represent different forms of
                            gender expression. Through this design, I hope to convey an important message: gender
                            identity is fluid and diverse, and everyone should have the freedom to define and express
                            themselves. I aim to encourage people to understand and respect different gender identities
                            with an open and inclusive attitude, hoping to contribute to promoting social acceptance of
                            gender diversity.</p>

                            Thoughts, emotions, and feelings of characters are expressed in a fluid, free, and
                            unconscious manner. In this free flow, characters express their ideas and emotions without
                            being constrained by any specific theme or plot. It represents the deep-seated feelings of
                            loneliness, fear, desire, and other emotions within the human psyche, as well as humanity's
                            sense of ignorance and helplessness about the world.</p>

                            When language and culture can flow freely, boundaries disappear. It is precisely this free
                            flow that makes boundaries less important, and when the flow is lacking, boundaries become
                            true barriers. The five landscapes of cultural flow are: Ethnoscapes, Mediascapes,
                            Technoscapes, Financescapes, Ideoscapes</p>
